# Numerical simulation of a pendulum
## Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo
### PME 3200 - General mechanics II

These programs were developed on *Scilab 6.1*, a open source software for numerical computation that can be downloaded on the [software's website](https://www.scilab.org/).

The codes were conceived while I was monitor of the subject "PME 3200 - General mechanics II". The goals of these exercises were to teach the students enrolled at the subject concepts such as: mechanical systems modelling, states vector, numerical solving of ODEs, as well as the interactions on systems with multiple degrees of freedom.

The exercises consists on the modelling of a pendulum and at each exercise more complex mechanical interactions were added to the system, accordingly to the topics the students were learning. The first exercise consists of a pendulum with viscous friction and an oscillating external momentum. On the following exercise, collision was added, and the pendulum collides with a wall at a given angle with a coefficient of restitution. At last, the mass, which was fixed to the pendulum, was replaced by a mass with a spring attached to the pendulum's joint and the system gained an additional degree of freedom.

The model and the results of each exercise will be described below.

### 1st Exercise (EP1)
The first exercise consists of a pendulum with a mass attached to the middle of its lenght

### 2st Exercise (EP2)

### 3st Exercise (EP3)
