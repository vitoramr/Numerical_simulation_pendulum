# Numerical simulation of a pendulum
## Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo
### PME 3200 - General mechanics II

These programs were developed on *Scilab 6.1*, a open source software for numerical computation that can be downloaded on the [software's website](https://www.scilab.org/).
The codes were conceived while I was monitor of the subject "PME 3200 - General mechanics II". The goals of these exercises were to teach the students enrolled at the subject concepts such as: mechanical systems modelling, states vector, numerical solving of ODEs, as well as the interactions on systems with multiple degrees of freedom.
